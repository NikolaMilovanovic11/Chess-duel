# Chess-duel
This game was made in JavaScript, with HTML and CSS. In this project, both white and black figures are controlled by a man. If a player attacks the opponent's king with his figure and threatens to take him, and the opponent cannot prevent that taking, it is said that the king is matted, which is the goal of this game.
